## üöÄ SYNOPSIS

The `get_next_line` project at 42 school challenges students to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor.

This project delves into file I/O and dynamic memory allocation in the C language, requiring students to handle various edge cases and efficiently manage memory.

Successful completion of the get_next_line project demonstrates proficiency in input/output operations and memory management, providing a practical understanding of handling file reading scenarios in C.

This project serves as a fundamental exploration of reading data from file descriptors and managing dynamic memory in the context of C programming.
